# IITB_Video_Analytics
This repository is for video analytics using Computer Vision, Machine Learning to summarize videos and obtain required results.


This repository is used to detect a person in video along with video summarization.

I have used HOGDescriptor of opencv to detect person. Multiple persons can be detected in a single frame.

The code is in developing mode. Accuracy can be increased and false alarms can be avoided.

python -m IITB_Video_Analytics.human\ detection.human_detection_summary -o IITB_Video_Analytics/human\ detection/output
