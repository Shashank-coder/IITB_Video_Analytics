# IITB_Video_Analytics
This repository is for video analytics using Computer Vision, Machine Learning to summarize videos and obtain required results.


This script is an integration of human detection, color detection and video summarization.

I have made this query based i.e. after running the script the user has to enter a color that is to be searched in the video.

In this script colors that can be detected are - yellow, green and blue.

If you enter anything else it will search for yellow color by default.

The code is in developing mode so more colors are to be integrated and the color detection accuracy is to be improved more.

# USAGE

python -m IITB_Video_Analytics.cloth\ detection.human_and_color_detection -o IITB_Video_Analytics/cloth\ detection/output
